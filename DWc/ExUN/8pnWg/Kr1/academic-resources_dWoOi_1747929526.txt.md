## What is this repo for?

This repo is aimed to build up a collection of resources useful to folks in the academic space who want content around Microsoft technologies, especially developing using the Cloud, in this case Azure. This includes educators wanting content to help build curriculum, students wanting further resources to expand their knowledge, hackathon organizers and attendees who want workshops, and computer society organizers who want content for events.

Although most of this content is aimed at the higher education space, there is content for K-12 educators and students.

## What kind of content are you after?

Anything that is either platform agnostic (such as programming language content), or focuses on Azure. As long as the content is applicable to the academic audiences described above, please add it.

Although the repo is in English, the content it links to is in multiple languages. We'd love as much international content as possible.

## Where will this content live?

Currently all the content lives in external repositories, this repo just contains a curated list of links. We will be looking to move some content 'in house' and bring it into this repo in the future.

## How can I add links?

Raise a PR! If you have links you would like to add, please raise a PR adding them to the relevant section.

## What if the links are broken or the content is outdated or inappropriate?

Please raise an issue. We have a number of labels to use when raising issues like this:

* Inappropriate content - use this label to flag links to content that does not adhere to our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* Broken link - use this for links that no longer work
* Outdated content - use this for content that is outdated and needs to be updated to the latest version of the relevant tools or technologies. We will then work with the author to get the content updated
